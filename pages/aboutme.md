Hello, I’m Ayesha Binte Mostofa from Dhaka,Bangladesh. I have completed my BSc. degree from the **[Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)](https://cse.buet.ac.bd/)** at **[Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)](https://www.buet.ac.bd/web/#/)**, the leading engineering University of Bangladesh. Currently, I am working as a full-time lecturer in the department of CSE, **[Canadian University of Bangladesh](https://www.cub.edu.bd)**. 

I have a strong interest in the intersection of **Systems**, **Network** & **Software Security**, and **Machine Learning** to solve real world problems. I'm also keen on exploring **Natural Language Processing**. During my undergraduate studies, I undertook a thesis titled **“Advancing Code Review and Code Refinement Automation Using Large Language Models”**, under the guidance of **[Professor Dr. Anindya Iqbal (BUET)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jAuiNFgAAAAJ&hl=en)** in collaboration with **[Dr. Toufique Ahmed (UC Davis)](https://toufiqueparag.github.io/toufique.github.io/)**. This research allowed me to dive into **Prompt Engineering** and **Quantized low rank adaptation fine-tuning**, working with closed-source models like GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4o, GPT-4-Turbo, Gemini-1-Pro and open-source models like Llama, CodeLlama. You can read the preprint : **[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10129)** (first author, equal contribution).

Now, I am applying my skills in a NLP X Security project, detecting attack behaviors of log data of **DARPA TC E3** and **DARPA OpTC** Dataset, whether it is benign or malicious using LLMs. We are working under the supervision of **[Professor Dr. Md. Shohrab Hossain (BUET)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=y89HApwAAAAJ&hl=en)** and **[Dr. Shahrear Iqbal (Research Officer, National Research Council, Canada)](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=cXS5b4sAAAAJ&hl=en)**. Our approach involves constructing provenance graphs and reverse trees (children-to-parent relationships). Subsequently, we generated event traces and then classified them. We labeled the data as either benign or malicious, aiming to supervise LLMs for precise detection of attack behavior. 

Apart from my research, I am also fortunate enough to contribute to the academic community through teaching. I’m currently the instructor of undergraduate-level courses on Structured Programming Language, Numerical Analysis, Computer Graphics etc. 

In addition to my academic pursuits, I have a passion for music and can play three types of instruments. For recreation, I enjoy developing games, doodling, traveling, and watching sitcoms.
